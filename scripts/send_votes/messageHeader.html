<p>Hello %NAME%,</p>
<p><b>This message is the voice of your constituency.</b> It's from NewBallot.org, a website that allows 
voters to vote on congressional legislation and then communicates their votes to you, their congress member, 
on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As you can see, NewBallot is just getting started. It's important to note that, though they claim to,
these voters have not yet been verified as living in your district; however, that verification 
is our next order of business, and will be implemented very soon. Please consider this information 
when representing your constituency. We hope NewBallot will become an essential communication tool between you 
and those you represent.</p>
<p>Thank you sincerely for your service to the American people.</p>
